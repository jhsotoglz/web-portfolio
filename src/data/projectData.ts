    details: `GridAI is a proprietary platform developed at Iowa State University to address challenges in modern energy distribution 
              systems. It provides solutions for predicting outages, optimizing power flow, and managing distributed energy resources 
              (DERs), enabling operators to maintain grid stability and efficiency.\n\n
    
              While GridAIâ€™s backend was robust, its baseline front-end had limitations that required enhancements to meet diverse user 
              needs. Our senior design team focused on improving existing components and developing new features to deliver a more 
              user-friendly and efficient interface.\n\n
              
              Within the team, I was responsible for designing and implementing a real-time widget system with a built-in code editor. 
              This system allows users to observe live electric grid data and customize widgets using code or settings to suit their 
              specific needs.\n\n
              
              I developed a comprehensive Widget Editor with a four-quadrant layout using React and TypeScript, enabling live code 
              editing with the Monaco Editor and real-time JSX previews powered by Babel. Users can modify widget templates, controller 
              scripts, and metadata such as title, measurement type, and Kafka node key.\n\n
              
              I also built and maintained various components, including the widget list manager, widget creation forms with predefined 
              templates, telemetry subscription handlers, and error-isolated rendering using React boundaries. On the backend, I 
              contributed to the Kafka-based real-time telemetry system, which filters, transforms, and emits live data through 
              WebSocket connections.\n\n
              
              The system implements full CRUD API endpoints for widget management, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete 
              widget configurations. These routes are secured using Firebase token authentication and persist data in Firestore. 
              Real-time updates ensure seamless dashboard integration and immediate feedback when working with live telemetry data.`,
