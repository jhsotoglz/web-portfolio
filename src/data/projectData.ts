    details: `GridAI is proprietary software created at Iowa State University with over four years of continuous 
              development to address the challenges of modern energy distribution systems. It offers solutions 
              for predicting outages, optimizing power flow, and managing distributed energy resources (DERs), 
              enabling operators to maintain grid stability and efficiency.

              While GridAIâ€™s backend was robust, its baseline front-end had limitations that required enhancements 
              to meet diverse user needs. Our senior design team focused on improving existing components and 
              developing new features to deliver a more user-friendly and efficient interface.`,
