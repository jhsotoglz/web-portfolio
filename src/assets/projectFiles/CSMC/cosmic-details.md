# CoSMiC Competition ‚Äì hosted by the Cardinal Space Mining Club at ISU

## Overview
The **Collegiate Space Mining Competition (CoSMiC)** is a **student-led Lunabotics-style robotics competition** launched by the **Cardinal Space Mining Club** at Iowa State University.  
When the team didn‚Äôt qualify for NASA‚Äôs official Lunabotics competition, the club created its own national event to continue pushing the boundaries of robotics and collaboration.

üìÖ **Hosted:** May 21‚Äì24  
üìç **Location:** Iowa State University  
ü§ù **Sponsored by:** Iowa Space Grant Consortium (ISGC)
