## Overview
The **Collegiate Space Mining Competition (CoSMiC)** is a **student-led Lunabotics-style robotics competition** launched by the **Cardinal Space Mining Club** at Iowa State University.  
When the team didn’t qualify for NASA’s official Lunabotics competition, the club created its own national event to continue pushing the boundaries of robotics and collaboration.

📅 **Hosted:** May 21–24  
📍 **Location:** Iowa State University  
🤝 **Sponsored by:** Iowa Space Grant Consortium (ISGC)
