## Overview
The **Collegiate Space Mining Competition (CoSMiC)** was a **student-led Lunabotics-style robotics competition** organized by the **Cardinal Space Mining Club** at Iowa State University.  

After the team did not qualify for NASAâ€™s official Lunabotics competition, the club launched its own national event to continue advancing robotics and fostering collaboration.

**Hosted:** May 21â€“24, 2025  
**Location:** Iowa State University  
**Sponsored by:** Iowa Space Grant Consortium (ISGC) and additional partners
