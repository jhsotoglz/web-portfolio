## Overview
**Face Security File System** is a **facial recognition-based command-line application** that protects personal files through biometric authentication and **symmetric encryption**.  

It is a work-in-progress project designed to deepen my knowledge of **Python**, with a focus on **computer vision**, **cryptography**, and **system design**.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages & Tools:** Python, CLI, NumPy  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, face_recognition  
- **Security:** Cryptography (Fernet symmetric encryption)  

---

## Features

#### ðŸ”¹ Current Capabilities
- **Face-based user registration** with encoded facial images.  
- **Real-time facial recognition login** via webcam.  
- **File encryption and decryption** using Fernet symmetric keys.  
- **Automatic deletion** of original or encrypted files upon conversion.  
- **CLI interface** for local testing and file protection.  

#### ðŸ”¹ Planned Improvements
- **Per-user key management** for stronger security.  
- **GUI interface** with Tkinter or PyQt for improved usability.  
- **Gesture-based controls** for alternative interaction.  
- **Key lifecycle management** with activity logging.

## Impact
This project serves as a **practical exploration of Pythonâ€™s ecosystem**, moving beyond traditional scripting into applied problem-solving.  
It demonstrates hands-on experience in:  
- **Computer vision** with real-time face recognition.  
- **Secure file handling** and encryption workflows.  
- Designing for both **usability** (CLI â†’ GUI evolution) and **security** (multi-user support, lifecycle tracking).  

It continues to be an effective way to expand my skills in **AI, security, and system design**.
