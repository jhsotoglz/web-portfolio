## Overview
**Face Security File System** is a **facial recognition-based command-line application** that protects personal files through biometric authentication and **symmetric encryption**.  
The project is a work-in-progress designed to deepen my knowledge of **Python**, exploring areas such as **computer vision**, **cryptography**, and **system design**.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Languages & Tools:** Python, CLI, NumPy  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, face_recognition  
- **Security:** Cryptography (Fernet symmetric encryption)  

---

## Current Features
- 👤 **Face-based user registration** with encoded facial images.  
- 📷 **Real-time facial recognition login** via webcam.  
- 🔒 **File encryption and decryption** using Fernet symmetric keys.  
- 🗑️ **Automatic deletion** of original or encrypted files upon conversion.  
- 💻 **CLI interface** for local testing and personal file protection.  

---

## Planned Improvements
- 🔑 **Per-user key management** for stronger access control.  
- 🖥️ **GUI interface** with Tkinter or PyQt for improved usability.  
- ✋ **Gesture-based controls** for alternative interaction.  
- 📜 **Key lifecycle management** with activity logging.  

---

## Impact
This project serves as a **practical exploration of Python’s ecosystem**, moving beyond traditional scripting into:  
- Applied **computer vision** through real-time face recognition.  
- Secure **file handling and encryption workflows**.  
- Designing for both **usability** (CLI → GUI evolution) and **security** (multi-user support, lifecycle tracking).  

It has been an excellent hands-on way to expand my skills in **AI, security, and system design**.
